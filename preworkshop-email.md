Hello all!

... greetings ...

Please fill in the questionaire from SWC.

The first two days will be a software carpentry workshop,
the agenda of which is here:

http://twitwi.github.io/2015-06-02-cern-lhcb/

Please follow the instructions below to make sure
you are ready to go when you arrive. You have to try
all the steps before you arrive as fixing some of the
problems involves a few days of waiting. So you would
end up watching instead of taking part!

If you have any questions or need help send us an email
at:

lhcb-starterkit@cern.ch

If you are feeling brave and would like to try installing
software on your laptop directly (which is not at all
required!) and need help email us or meet in R1 (precise location)
on Monday afternoon. Again, you do not have to install
things on your laptop if you do not want to and we will
have some time dedicated to setting things up at the end
of the workshop.

See you soon!
